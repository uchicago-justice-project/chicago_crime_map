            For the first six months of 2025 Chicago has seen a <strong>17.67%</strong> drop in violent crime 
            compared to the first six months of 2024. This map shows the percent difference in violent crime through the first six months
            between 2024 and 2025 aggregated by police beats. Areas shaded in blue indicate a decrease in violent crime, while
            areas shaded in red indicate an increase. The deeper the shade, the larger the change.

            In September 2024 Chicago cancelled their contract with Shotspotter which installed sensors all over
            Chicago to detect gunshots. Despite a lack of strong evidence in support of Shotspotter's efficacy some
            argued that the cancelation of the contract would increase crime in those areas (largely the south and west 
            sides of Chicago). However the areas where sensors were located shown here still saw a <strong>17.76%</strong>
            decrease in violent crime without those sensors being active, putting them in line with the city wide decrease.

            Chicago PD also utilized hotspot analysis to determine what areas to divert more resources to. Many have
            cited this as a possible reason for the decreasing crime rate. The police beats with hotspots saw a 
            decrease of <strong>17.97%</strong> roughly the same as the overall city.

            In addition to policing measures and surveilance technology, Chicago and the state of Illinois increased
            thier investments in violence prevention programs, in particular Peacekeepers. This program trains community
            members as outreach workers to prevent violence from occuring in hotspots in their neighborhoods. Areas with
            a Peacekeeper hotspot saw a decrease in violent crime of <strong>20.46%</strong>, beating the citywide average.
